With "Hands-on Elixir & OTP: Cryptocurrency trading bot", you will **gain hands-on experience by writing an exciting software project from scratch.** We will explore all the key abstractions and essential principles through iterative implementation improvements.

We will start by creating a new umbrella application, subscribing to WebSocket streams, implementing a basic trading flow, and focusing on improving it by expanding on the topics like supervision trees, resiliency, refactoring using macros, utilising the Registry, testing and others.

**This book is 90% complete - chapters 1-20 are finished,** and I'll add more content soon. It's also a loosely written representation of the [Hands-on Elixir & OTP: Cryptocurrency trading bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYIx7M6o28&list=PLxsE19GnjC5Nv1CbeKOiS5YqGqw35aZFJ) video course released on YouTube.

## Contributing, Errata and Source code {-}

The book is written using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)(it's a very similar syntax to the GitHub markdown but supports many more features including code execution, etc.) and converted to final form (for example PDF) using the [bookdown](https://www.bookdown.org/) app. This means that editing a chapter is as simple as editing the markdown source of that chapter.

There are two repositories related to this book(both hosted on Github):

* [source code of the book itself](https://github.com/Cinderella-Man/hands-on-elixir-and-otp-cryptocurrency-trading-bot)
* [code written across the book where the final code of each chapter has its own branch](https://github.com/Cinderella-Man/hands-on-elixir-and-otp-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-source-code)

In regards to contributions - I would love to follow the standard process of forking, making changes, opening PR(please look is there a branch for the next version and point to it instead of `main`), merging, and releasing a new version of the book.

This books has also the **GitHub Discussions** enabled for both the [book's repo](https://github.com/Cinderella-Man/hands-on-elixir-and-otp-cryptocurrency-trading-bot/discussions) as well as [source code's repo](https://github.com/Cinderella-Man/hands-on-elixir-and-otp-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-source-code/discussions), please feel welcome to start any discussions related to book there.
