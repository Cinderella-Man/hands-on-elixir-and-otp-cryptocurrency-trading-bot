# Run multiple traders in parallel

## Objectives

- describe and design the required functionality
- implement rebuy in the `Naive.Trader`
- implement rebuy in the `Naive.Leader`
- improve logs by assigning ids to traders

## Describe and design the required functionality

At this moment, inside the `Naive.Leader` we have a silly code that starts all of the traders at the same moment:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
    # /apps/naive/lib/naive/leader.ex
    ...
    traders =
      for _i <- 1..settings.chunks,
          do: start_new_trader(trader_state)
    ...
```

All the changes we made in this episode will enable us to fix this.

\newpage

Let's say that we placed a buy order that got filled and the price has fallen before reaching the sell level. We can see here that we missed a nice opportunity to buy more as price drops and make money as it climbs back:

```{r, fig.align="center", out.height="20%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter_09_01_single_trader.png")
```

We will implement an additional trade event callback inside the `Naive.Trader` that will keep checking the price after the buy order has been filled. Whenever a price drops below the `buy_order`'s `price` by `rebuy_interval` we will notify the `Naive.Leader` to start the new `Naive.Trader` process:

```{r, fig.align="center", out.height="20%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter_09_02_multi_traders.png")
```

The `Naive.Leader` keeps track of how many `Naive.Trader`s are running and needs to honor the number of `chunks` set up in the settings (one chunk == one trader).

To stop the `Naive.Trader`s from continuously notifying about a drop in the price we will also introduce a boolean flag that will track has the `Naive.Leader` been already notified.

## Implement rebuy inside `Naive.Trader`

We will start by adding the `rebuy_interval` and the `rebuy_notified` to the trader's state:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/trader.ex
  ...
  defmodule State do
    @enforce_keys [
      :symbol,
      :budget,
      :buy_down_interval,
      :profit_interval,
      :rebuy_interval, # <= add this field
      :rebuy_notified, # <= add this field
      :tick_size,
      :step_size
    ]
    defstruct [
      :symbol,
      :budget,
      :buy_order,
      :sell_order,
      :buy_down_interval,
      :profit_interval,
      :rebuy_interval, # <= add this field
      :rebuy_notified, # <= add this field
      :tick_size,
      :step_size
    ]
  end
```

Rebuy logic should be placed almost as the last callback just before the one that ignores all events. We will need to retrieve the current `price` and `buy_price` and confirm that we didn't notify the leader yet(`rebuy_notified` flag):

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/trader.ex
  ...
  # sell filled callback here
  ...
  def handle_info(
        %TradeEvent{
          price: current_price
        },
        %State{
          symbol: symbol,
          buy_order: %Binance.OrderResponse{
            price: buy_price
          },
          rebuy_interval: rebuy_interval,
          rebuy_notified: false
        } = state
      ) do

  end
  # catch all callback here
```

We need to calculate is the current price below the rebuy interval. If yes we will notify the leader and update the boolean flag. We will abstract calculation to separate function(for readability) that we will write below:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
    # /apps/naive/lib/naive/trader.ex
    # body of the above callback
    if trigger_rebuy?(buy_price, current_price, rebuy_interval) do
      Logger.info("Rebuy triggered for #{symbol} trader")
      new_state = %{state | rebuy_notified: true}
      Naive.Leader.notify(:rebuy_triggered, new_state)
      {:noreply, new_state}
    else
      {:noreply, state}
    end
```

As mentioned before, we will set the `rebuy_notified` boolean flag to true and notify the leader using the `notify` function with the dedicated atom.

At the bottom of the module we need to add the `trigger_rebuy?` helper function:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/trader.ex
  # bottom of the module
  defp trigger_rebuy?(buy_price, current_price, rebuy_interval) do
    rebuy_price =
      D.sub(
        buy_price,
        D.mult(buy_price, rebuy_interval)
      )

    D.lt?(current_price, rebuy_price)
  end
```

## Implement rebuy in the `Naive.Leader`

Moving on to the `Naive.Leader` module, we can get update starting of the traders automatically by the leader to starting just one inside `handle_continue`:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/leader.ex
  def handle_continue(:start_traders, %{symbol: symbol} = state) do
    ...
    traders = [start_new_trader(trader_state)] # <= updated part

    ...
  end
```

We will need to add a new clause of the `notify` function that will handle the rebuy scenario:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/leader.ex
  # add below current `notify` function
  def notify(:rebuy_triggered, trader_state) do
    GenServer.call(
      :"#{__MODULE__}-#{trader_state.symbol}",
      {:rebuy_triggered, trader_state}
    )
  end
```

We need to add a new `handle_call` function that will start new traders only when there are still chunks available(enforce the maximum number of parallel traders) - let's start with a header:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/leader.ex
  # place this one after :update_trader_state handle_call
  def handle_call(
        {:rebuy_triggered, new_trader_state},
        {trader_pid, _},
        %{traders: traders, symbol: symbol, settings: settings} = state
      ) do

  end
```

There are few important details to make note of:

* we need the trader's PID to be able to find it details inside the list of traders
* we need settings to confirm the number of chunks to be able to limit the maximum number of parallel traders



Moving on to the body of our callback. As with other ones, we will check can we find a trader inside the list of traders, and based on that we will either start another one(if we didn't reach the limit of chunks) or ignore it:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
    # /apps/naive/lib/naive/leader.ex
    # body of our callback
    case Enum.find_index(traders, &(&1.pid == trader_pid)) do
      nil ->
        Logger.warn("Rebuy triggered by trader that leader is not aware of")
        {:reply, :ok, state}

      index ->
        old_trader_data = Enum.at(traders, index)
        new_trader_data = %{old_trader_data | :state => new_trader_state}
        updated_traders = List.replace_at(traders, index, new_trader_data)

        updated_traders =
          if settings.chunks == length(traders) do
            Logger.info("All traders already started for #{symbol}")
            updated_traders
          else
            Logger.info("Starting new trader for #{symbol}")
            [start_new_trader(fresh_trader_state(settings)) | updated_traders]
          end

        {:reply, :ok, %{state | :traders => updated_traders}}
    end
```

In the above code, we need to remember to update the state of the trader that triggered the rebuy inside the `traders` list as well as add the state of a new trader to that list.

As with other setting we will hardcode the `rebuy_interval`(inside the `fetch_symbol_settings` function) and assign them to
trader's state(inside the `fresh_trader_state` function):

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/leader.ex
  defp fresh_trader_state(settings) do
    %{
      struct(Trader.State, settings)
      | budget: D.div(settings.budget, settings.chunks),
        rebuy_notified: false # <= add this line
    }
  end

  defp fetch_symbol_settings(symbol) do
    ...

    Map.merge(
      %{
        ...
        chunks: 5, # <= update to 5 parallel traders max
        budget: 100, # <= update this line
        ...
        profit_interval: "-0.0012",
        rebuy_interval: "0.001" # <= add this line
      },
      symbol_filters
    )
  end
```

We also update the `chunks` and the `budget` to allow our strategy to start up to 5 parallel traders with a budget of 20 USDT each(100/5) as Binance has minimal order requirement at about $15(when using the `BinanceMock` this doesn't really matter).

## Improve logs by assigning ids to traders

The final change will be to add an `id` to the trader's state so we can use it inside log messages to give us meaningful data about what's going on(otherwise we won't be able to tell which message was logged by which trader).

First, let's add the `id` into the `Naive.Leader`'s fresh_trader_state as it will be defined per trader:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/leader.ex
  defp fresh_trader_state(settings) do
    %{
      struct(Trader.State, settings)
      | id: :os.system_time(:millisecond), # <= add this line
        budget: D.div(settings.budget, settings.chunks),
        rebuy_notified: false
    }
  end
```

Now we can move on to the `Naive.Trader` and add it to the `%State{}` struct as well as we will modify every callback to include that id inside log messages:

```{r, engine = 'elixir', eval = FALSE}
  # /apps/naive/lib/naive/trader.ex
  defmodule State do
    @enforce_keys [
      :id,
      ...
    ]
    defstruct [
      :id,
      ...
    ]
  end

  ...

  def init(%State{id: id, symbol: symbol} = state) do
    ...

    Logger.info("Initializing new trader(#{id}) for #{symbol}")

    ...
  end

  def handle_info(
        %TradeEvent{price: price},
        %State{
          id: id,
          ...
        } = state
      ) do
    ...

    Logger.info(
      "The trader(#{id}) is placing a BUY order " <>
        "for #{symbol} @ #{price}, quantity: #{quantity}"
    )

    ...
  end

  def handle_info(
        %TradeEvent{
          buyer_order_id: order_id
        },
        %State{
          id: id,
          ...
        } = state
      ) do
    ...
        Logger.info(
          "The trader(#{id}) is placing a SELL order for " <>
            "#{symbol} @ #{sell_price}, quantity: #{quantity}."
        )
        ...
        Logger.info("Trader's(#{id} #{symbol} BUY order got partially filled")
        ...
  end

  def handle_info(
        %TradeEvent{
          seller_order_id: order_id
        },
        %State{
          id: id,
          ...
        } = state
      ) do
    ...
      Logger.info("Trader(#{id}) finished trade cycle for #{symbol}")
      ...
      Logger.info("Trader's(#{id} #{symbol} SELL order got partially filled")
      ...
  end

  def handle_info(
        %TradeEvent{
          price: current_price
        },
        %State{
          id: id,
          ...
        } = state
      ) do
      ...
      Logger.info("Rebuy triggered for #{symbol} by the trader(#{id})")
      ...
  end
```

That finishes the implementation part - we should now be able to test the implementation and see a dynamically growing number of traders for our strategy based on price movement.

## Test the implementation

Let's start an iEx session and open the `:observer`(inside go to "Applications" tab and click on `naive` from the list of the left) so we will be able to see how the number of traders is growing as well as PIDs are changing which means that they are finishing the full trades:

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}

...

...

```

And our observer shows the following:

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter_09_supervision_tree.png")
```

We can clearly see that our strategy dynamically scaled from 1 to 5 parallel traders and they were going through different trading steps without any problems - I think that's really cool to see and it wasn't difficult to achieve in Elixir.

[Note] Please remember to run the `mix format` to keep things nice and tidy.
